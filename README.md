## Insculpo
#### Latin : Engrave, Cut Into.

Insculpo is a simplified note-taking app , focused on the note-taking experience and working backward from there.
<br/>It is designed mainly for my personal use and maybe in the future will be available for public use.

Many note-taking apps today feature very complex UI's and data strucures and how to organize every little note you write.This works for a lot of people , but I'm not one of them , I don't exactly take notes , I scribble on any piece of paper or writing materials I have in front of me , I've even scribbled on a leaf.So the structure and organization of many of these notes apps , hinder me from getting to the point of my note and instead thinking of which folder it fits into and which tags will help me find it the fastest.

Insculpo is designed to rid me of that and instead allow me to focus on getting the note down first and only think of organzing it when the thoughts have been solidified.

It features a centralized and full-screen text area.This , is where the writing will take place.Then when you're done and finally ready to arrange things , you can open up the sidebar and do the arranging you need to , but only when you're sure everything is solid.


If you find the project interesting , you can contact me to know more and maybe get a private build of the app to use if you like it enough.
