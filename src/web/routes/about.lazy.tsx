          Insculpo is a markdown based note-taking app focused on taking notes
          first and organizing them later by allowing you to get to the point of
          the note first and only organizing when your thoughts are crystal
          clear by removing the fatigue of the inital note taking process and
          simply giving you a blank notepad at the start.
